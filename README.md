## Problem Statement :

The growing demand for natural language processing (NLP) and chatbot technologies has resulted in an increase in innovative mobile and web applications that use these technologies to enhance user interactions with technology. One such API is ChatGPT, a large language model API that offers a range of NLP services. The aim of this problem statement is to develop a mobile/web application that utilizes ChatGPT's capabilities to create a user-friendly and innovative chatbot-based interface. The chatbot must be able to handle complex queries and provide accurate responses while delivering an intuitive and easy-to-use experience for users.

The participants are required to develop a chatbot that is capable of understanding users' preferences, history, and context to provide personalized responses and recommendations. The chatbot should be integrated with other APIs and services such as weather, news, and e-commerce to provide a comprehensive user experience. Furthermore, the application should leverage the powerful NLP capabilities of ChatGPT to enhance the chatbot's accuracy, understanding, and ability to handle natural language queries. 

Developing a scalable chatbot architecture is a crucial aspect of this problem statement. The chatbot architecture must be able to handle a large number of users and queries simultaneously, with minimal latency. To test and ideate, participants are encouraged to use the chat feature of the ChatGPT website. However, the final application should only use ChatGPT's API, and the API usage must be limited to $5. 

In summary, the challenge is to create a chatbot-based interface that delivers an exceptional user experience by utilizing ChatGPT's NLP capabilities and integrating with other APIs. The chatbot must be personalized, intuitive, and easy to use while being scalable to handle a large number of users and queries with minimal latency, all within the $5 API usage limit provided by ChatGPT.
